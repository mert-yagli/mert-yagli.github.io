Hi there! I am a researcher specializing in solar resource assessment and forecasting. I enjoy not only developing research ideas but also implementing them in real-time operational products.

I earned my Ph.D. from the National University of Singapore in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department in 2020. My thesis title is "Data-driven Post-processing of Ensemble Solar Forecasts for Improved Accuracy in Solar Forecasting."

I design, develop, and implement cutting-edge, real-time solar forecasting models tailored to the dynamic Asia Pacific region. My solar forecasting models integrate machine learning techniques with a diverse array of input data sources. By combining multiple forecasting models with an extensive dataset, I harness the power of numerical weather predictions, satellite imagery, and ground sensor readings to produce actionable, real-time solar forecasts.

I engage in solar data analysis and science all day, every day.

This is my operational Himawari satellite image-to-irradiance conversion model in action, which I developed and implemented entirely from scratch. Look how beautiful it is!
