Hi there! I am a researcher specializing in solar resource assessment and forecasting. I enjoy not only developing research ideas but also implementing them in real-time operational products.

I design, develop, and implement cutting-edge, real-time solar forecasting models tailored to the dynamic Asia-Pacific region. My models combine numerical weather predictions, satellite imagery, ground sensor measurements, and machine learning to deliver the latest advancements. By integrating multiple forecasting models with extensive datasets, I produce actionable, real-time solar forecasts.

I engage in solar data analysis and science all day, every day.

This is my operational Himawari satellite image-to-irradiance conversion model in action, which I developed and implemented entirely from scratch. Look how beautiful it is!
