<h2> Abstract </h2>
With the increase in demand for energy, penetration of alternative sources of energy in the power grid has increased. Photovoltaic (PV) energy is the most common and popular form of energy sources which is widely integrated into the existing grid. As solar energy is intermittent in nature, to ensure uninterrupted and reliable power supply to the prosumers, it is essential to forecast the solar irradiance. Accurate solar forecasting is necessary to facilitate large-scale modelling and deployment of PV plants without disrupting the quality and reliability of the power grid as well as to manage the power demand and supply. There are various methods to predict the solar irradiance such as numerical weather prediction methods, satellite-based approaches, cloud-image based methodologies, data-driven methods, and sensor-network based approaches. This study gives an overall review of the different resources and methods used for forecasting solar irradiance in different time horizons and also gives an extensive review of the sensor networks that are used for determining solar irradiance. The various error metrics and accessible data sets available for the sensor networks are also discussed that can be used for validation purposes.
