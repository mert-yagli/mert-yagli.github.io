excerpt: '[AI-generated abstract summary] This study highlights that current solar forecast verification focuses too much on comparing methods rather than assessing how well the best method performs relative to the best possible outcome. It addresses the gap in understanding predictability and forecast skill of solar irradiance, especially in spatial distribution. By quantifying and mapping these aspects across the U.S., the study clarifies misconceptions about irradiance predictability and revisits the original formulation of the skill score. '

<h2> Abstract </h2>
Current solar forecast verification processes place much attention on performance comparison of a group of competing methods. However, forecast verification ought to further answer how the best method within the group performs relative to the best-possible performance which one can attain under that forecasting situation, which makes the quantification of predictability and forecast skill immediately relevant. Unfortunately, the literature on the quantification of relative performance of solar irradiance has hitherto been lacking, and very few studies have focused on the spatial distributions of predictability and forecast skill of solar irradiance. The predictability and forecast skill of an atmospheric process depend on two concepts: (1) the growth of initial error in unresolved scale of motion, and (2) the forecast performance of the standard of reference. Based upon this formalism, predictability and forecast skill of solar irradiance in the United States are quantified and mapped. Through this study, a couple of common misconceptions in regard to irradiance predictability are refuted, and the original formulation of skill score revived.
