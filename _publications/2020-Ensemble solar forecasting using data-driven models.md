excerpt: '[AI-generated abstract summary] This study addresses the challenge of forecast performance variability in data-driven models due to local weather conditions, proposing ensemble forecasting to combine multiple models for better accuracy. However, raw ensemble forecasts often suffer from underdispersion, which affects calibration. To improve forecast accuracy, the study calibrates hourly ensemble clear-sky index forecasts from 20 models using parametric and nonparametric post-processing techniques.

<h2> Abstract </h2>
Forecast performance of data-driven models depends on the local weather and climate regime, which makes model selection a tedious task for forecast practitioners. Ensemble forecasting, or forecast combination, is beneficial in such cases, in that, forecasts from multiple models are combined to form a final forecast. In ensemble forecasting, additional to the final deterministic-style forecasts, predictive distributions are also available, which can be used by grid operators for better decision-making. Such empirical predictive distributions are useful to represent the uncertainty associated with the forecasts. However, raw ensemble forecasts are often not calibrated, e.g., due to the lack of diversity in the ensemble members. The lack of ensemble spread is known as underdispersion, and it can be ameliorated through post-processing.

This study aims to calibrate hourly ensemble clear-sky index forecasts, generated by 20 data-driven models, using both parametric and nonparametric post-processing techniques. Four years of data collected at 7 research-grade sites are used in the empirical part of the paper. Quantitative and qualitative methods are used to evaluate the performance of post-processing techniques in terms of calibration and sharpness. Post-processed ensemble forecasts outperform raw ensemble forecasts under all verification metrics. The proposed parametric post-processing technique, namely, generalized additive models for location, scale and shape, substantially reduces the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) of the raw ensemble forecasts from 32--59 W/m$^2$ to 25--45 W/m$^2$ and quantile score from 16--30 W/m$^2$ to 13--23 W/m$^2$. In terms of CRPS skill score, the proposed method achieved 38--58% improvements over a climatology reference.
