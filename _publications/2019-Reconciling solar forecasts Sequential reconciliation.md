excerpt: '[AI-generated abstract summary] This article extends previous works on forecast reconciliation for photovoltaic (PV) power generation by addressing both geographical and temporal hierarchies simultaneously. Building on earlier studies that handled these hierarchies separately, this work applies sequential reconciliation for day-ahead forecasting of 318 PV systems in California. The results demonstrate that using sequential reconciliation ensures consistent forecasts across both geographical and temporal hierarchies, and also improves forecast accuracy compared to single-hierarchy approaches.'

<h2> Abstract </h2>
When forecasting hierarchical photovoltaic (PV) power generation in a region and/or over several forecast horizons, reconciliation is needed to ensure the lower-level forecasts add up exactly to the upper-level forecasts. Previously in "Reconciling solar forecasts: Geographical hierarchy" [Sol. Energy 146 (2017) 276–286] and "Reconciling solar forecasts: Temporal hierarchy" [Sol. Energy 158 (2017) 332–346], forecast reconciliation has been demonstrated for geographical and temporal hierarchies, separately. This article follows such frameworks and extends the reconciliation to spatio-temporal cases. More specifically, sequential reconciliation is used for operational day-ahead forecasting of 318 PV systems in California. It is shown that by using sequential reconciliation, aggregate-consistent forecasts can be obtained across both the geographical and temporal hierarchies. In addition, the forecast accuracy can be further improved from that of the single-hierarchy cases.
